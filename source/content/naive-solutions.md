Summary: A solution you *create* quickly may be more trouble than it's worth, or, "Why I'm taking Algorithms: Design and Analysis"

While watching the [Integer Multiplication](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/165?s=e) video as part of [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo), I finally found the language to describe a problem that's bothered me for quite some time. 

There was a phenomenon I noticed in my career in accounting when it came to problem solving. It had two parts:

1. Find a solution as **quickly** as possible. Five minutes of thinking is probably too long
2. Go with the first solution you come up with that's **easy** to understand.

While these steps may seem fine (*"why waste time and/or come up with a complicated solution?"*) There are two problems with this approach:

1. A solution you find quickly may not be well thought out (well-designed)
2. A solution that's easy to **understand** (especially in a short period of time) may actually be more difficult to **implement**. This is an even larger problem if it's a solution that's going to be used repeatedly over time.

I've seen this multiple times. There's a meeting, to figure out how to do 'this thing'. It's usually something that's been asked for out of the blue. So, there's a rush to come up with something ASAP. The faster you find a solution, the better. And bonus points for it being a solution that's easily *understood*. Not easily performed or well-performed. Just easily understood while it's being discussed.

Here's the problem with this solution: no one thinks through the implementation details. So, in 60 seconds, you come up with a new daily/weekly/monthly task that's going to take HOURS to perform each day/week/month. In perpetuity. Because it SEEMED simple and straightforward when you spent 60 seconds talking about it.

Thanks to Computer Science, I now have a formal name for this. **The naive solution**.
