Summary: A solution you *create* quickly may be more trouble than it's worth.

While watching the [Interger Multiplication](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/165?s=e) video as part of [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo), I finally found the language to describe a problem that's bothered me for quite some time. 

There was a phenomenon I noticed in my career in accounting when it came to problem solving. It had two parts:

1. Find a solution as **quickly** as possible. Five minutes of thinking is probably too long
2. Go with the first solution you come up with that's **easy** to understand.
