<!-- This is where I'll list the projects I'm working on. Some of that info will come from [these ideas](https://github.com/kojoidrissa/random_30Day_code/blob/master/projects.md)  Other info will come from other documents.

I'll probably also make this a multi-purpose projects page.

-  Projects I NEED to work on
-  Projects I AM working on
-  Projects I've finished.

## Need To Do
-  Flesh out this page
-  Write a script (probably Bash) to automate the moving of Inktober images form Dropbox to my blog
