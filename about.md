## About Me
I'm Kojo Idrissa. You may have seen me at a Django or Python event or conference. I've got an accounting degree and an MBA. I started my first software engineering job 2015-12-01. I'm also a DjangoCon US organizer and [DEFNA](https://www.defna.org/) board member. Also, other things

More to come.

## Why?
I've started my 2017 Spreadsheet talks with a "motivation" section. It occured to me it would be better to commit that to writing, point people to it, and cut the time on my talks.

I got serious about becoming a software developer, focused on Python, in late 2012. I say that because I'd learned Git during the summer of 2011 while working with Drupal (there's a bit of a story there) and had even made some small commits to Drupal Core. But October or so of 2012 was when I decided, "Ok, I'm gonna learn me some Python for REAL".

Jump ahead to June or so of 2013. I'd taken a Python course [on Coursera](https://es.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program).
