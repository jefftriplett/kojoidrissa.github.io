No post yesterday, but I did push code. So that was nice.

I wasn't super productive today, then got a burst of productivity in the evening. Got a bit of code pushed out.  I also got an answer to a not-super-important, but still interesting, question. And it was related to the topic I was coding about. So that helped.

BUT, since I've got to be a bit more productive in the morning than usual, I'll talk about that tomorrow.
