## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_(Wu_Xing)) [Water Buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_buffalo_(zodiac))
Starting the 3rd of 5 cycles.

After almost a week off, I FINALLY got back to Obeying the Testing Goat. I [made good progress](https://github.com/kojoidrissa/superlist/commits/master) and finished [Chapter 3](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_unit_test_first_view.html). Next stop, [Chapter 4](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_philosophy_and_refactoring.html).

Today was a long day, with a [DEFNA](https://www.defna.org/) board meeting after work, then some family stuff. Not sure what I've got going on tomorrow. I know I want to figure out how to put line numbers in my code snippets. I think I've seen how to do that. I've got a tiny code demo I want to talk about tomorrow.

That's all for tonight!

Oh yeah, [here's](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#line-numbers) the line number thing. I may just have to devote a week of evenings (or a weekend) to learning [Jekyll's Liquid](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates).
