## Traditional: [學](http://www.learnchineseez.com/read-write/traditional/view.php?code=4f86&last=1)

## Simplified: [学](http://www.learnchineseez.com/read-write/simplified/view.php?code=6765&last=1)

VERY much one of my favorite hanzi, mostly because of it's meaning. It's also in one of the phrases I mentioned before, [人民大学]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-10-08-inktober_08 %}), that I forced myself to learn to say before my first trip to China.


This is also an interesting example of the difference b/w [Traditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters) and [Simplified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters) hanzi. And I kind of like BOTH versions (although I'm always partial to Traditional). But I always use Simplified when I write *人民大学* because it's a mainland university. 

Please to enjoy, 我的書法! Ok, "enjoy" may be a bit strong, based on the quality of my skills. 😕
