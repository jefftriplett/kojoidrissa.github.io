I took yesterday off. And now I'm in the [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/chat) chat on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CodeNewbie&src=tyah). It's based on the podcast episode about [freelancing](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/should-you-start-freelancing).

Did some planning for the next couple of weeks and months today. It helps to look forward a bit, to make sure you're getting things lined up. And sometimes, new coding ideas come out of it!  More on those, as they develop.

Later!
