## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(Wu_Xing)) [Goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat_(zodiac))

It's easy to make plans, then move forward without acting on them. This evening I'm working on [Chapter 3](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_unit_test_first_view.html) of Obey The Testing Goat, but I'm also remember the other things I need to work on. Some of those may have to wait until this weekend. 

-  Get a better understanding of why and how things like Base64 text encoding are used, so I can write a post about it
-  Get going on updating my die-rolling app
-  Updating my [About]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}), [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}) and [Presentations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link presentations.md %}) pages
-  I've got some [DEFNA](https://www.defna.org/) responsibilities to attend to
-  I had a few of different things I pushed back because of Hurricane Harvey and my Viet sister's dad's funeral. I need to catch up with those

Onward and upward!

## Update {{ page.update | date: "%F %R" }}

I decided to stop early for the night and pick up with "[Django's MVC, URLs and View Functions](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_unit_test_first_view.html#_django_s_mvc_urls_and_view_functions)".

I also took the time to figure out how to add a new variable to the post, `update`, so I can show the update time and format it the way I want. I may tinker with that and make it a permanent addition to the post layout. I'm learning, slowly but surely!
