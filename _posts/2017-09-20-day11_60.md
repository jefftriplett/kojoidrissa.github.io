## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(Wu_Xing)) [Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(zodiac))

Not a lot of personal coding today...ran into some unexpected family issues. I've been learning more about [Base64 encoding](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html) at work. It's what you use to turn a binary file (an image, a Word doc, etc) into printable ASCII text. That allows it to be sent via certain methods that REQUIRE plain ASCII text. I've had to convert an image from one format to another, THEN into Base64 text.

Personally, I want to build a [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}) page, to list the stuff I want to work on. Having it in one place on the site will be helpful for me. I hope. I put placeholders up for that and a [Presentations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link presentations.md %}) page
