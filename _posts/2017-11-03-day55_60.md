## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_(Wu_Xing)) [Goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat_(zodiac))
It's been an interesting day.

The [Houston Astros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros) had their parade today, after winning the [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_World_Series). And the Overwatch World Cup [Quarter-finals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_World_Cup_2017#Playoff_bracket) started today as well. I'm not a HUGE baseball fan, but I do love me some Overwatch. So, I'm [watching that](https://go.twitch.tv/playoverwatch)

I'm starting back at [Three Strikes and Refactor](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_post_and_database.html#_three_strikes_and_refactor), but I'm not sure how far I'll get tonight. Since my sleep improvements are an ongoing thing, I don't want to stay up too late. I'd rather be up early tomorrow and get back to work then. We'll see what happens.
