## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(Wu_Xing)) [Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_(zodiac))

We're 1/2 way through!!!

I got to work today to find out a co-worker was unexpectedly unable to go to the [Rice Data Science Conference](http://dsconference.rice.edu/), which is today and tomorrow. We'd already paid for the ticket, so they asked if anyone else wanted to go in his place. So, I went. Because, of COURSE I went to a conference.

Part of the great humor in this is I'd JUST recorded an episode of [Productivity In Tech](https://productivityintech.com/pitpodcast) podcast with [Jay Miller](https://twitter.com/kjaymiller) YESTERDAY, where we talked about me going to conferences. I listed the conferences I'd gone to and was going to in 2017. So, THAT episode was out of date in about 16 hours!

I might have a conference problem. But at least I'm not speaking at or organizing this one in ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM!

Lots of interesting stuff today, and tomorrow's a full day. That includes a talk by [Yulan](https://twitter.com/y3l2n), who I got to hang out with today. We know a bunch of the same people and have PROBABLY met before, but never really hung out until now. She's [giving a talk](http://sched.co/C9Q8) I'm very much looking forward to tomorrow after lunch.

In code news, I'm realizing I should probably write some sort of script to help automate the process I'm using to move my [#inktober](https://twitter.com/hashtag/inktober2017?src=hash) images from Dropbox to Jekyll. And THAT reminds me that I should probably start logging my, "I need to write code for this" ideas here on the site. My [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}) page could use some love. I guess it'll have to be home to "Active" and "Completed" projects? Who knows?
