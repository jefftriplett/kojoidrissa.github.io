I was gonna title this, "The Life-Changing Magic of Giving Up", but I thought that was a little TOO cutesy.

I had to decide to give up on something code-related today, so I could be free to move forward with other code-related things. Also, there's a limit to the number of things you can work on at the same time. Sometimes you have to get rid of things to make room for other things.
