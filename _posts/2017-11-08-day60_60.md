Challenge ends.

I wrote a LOT less code than I'd hoped/expected, but I started the challenge in a [state of fatigue]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-20-busy_summer %}), so that's not too shocking. It actually became [part of the plan]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-21-day12_60 %}) pretty early on.

An unexpected, but need change was me working seriously on improving my sleep. It's only been a few days, but it seems to be going well. I've gotten more sleep and even got up early and exercised one morning. ðŸ˜±

I might update this later tonight, or I may wait until later to do a Retrospective.
