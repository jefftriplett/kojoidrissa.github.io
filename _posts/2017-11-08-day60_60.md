Challenge ends.


An unexpected, but need change was me working seriously on improving my sleep. It's only been a few days, but it seems to be going well. I've gotten more sleep and even got up early and exercised one morning. ðŸ˜±

I might update this later tonight, or I may wait until later to do a Retrospective.
