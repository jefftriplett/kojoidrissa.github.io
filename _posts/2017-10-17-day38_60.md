## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(Wu_Xing)) [Tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_(zodiac))

Our local [Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/preview/python-14/events/242603685) is tonight. We're getting ready for it. And, by "getting ready", I mean watching 'The Force Awakens' after we got the chairs and projector set up.

I'm also working on my [Presentations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link presentations.md %}) page and updating my Trello board.

There might be an update later.
