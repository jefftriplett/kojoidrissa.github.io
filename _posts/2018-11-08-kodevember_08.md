Despite my best intentions, I did NOT produce a lot of finished artifacts today. And the [post I mentioned yesterday]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-07-kodevember_07 %}) still isn't done. I want to give it a bit more thought, so I can express the idea properly. It would be easy to express it poorly, which is NOT my goal.

In other news: I've ended up with more new ideas and plans than actual output today.  Sometimes that's how it goes. But I'm also trying to be more disciplined in my plans for 2019, after overextending myself a bit in 2018. [#NorAmGT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NorAmGT&src=typd) will continue, but it will need to take a slightly different form.

I also need to work on some new ideas for my Python Day MX presentation.
