I've spent most of today watching the [Overwatch World Cup](https://worldcup.playoverwatch.com/en-us/). Today is the final day. There have been lots of surprises. Looks like Canada/🇨🇦 has won the Bronze medal, after taking the Silver last year. If you're interested, you can follow the [#OWWC2018](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23owwc2018&src=typd) hashtag on Twitter.

## Update
After a day of Overwatch World Cup (대한민국/🇰🇷 took Gold, as expected, 中华人民共和国/🇨🇳 took an unexpected Silver), I'm going to take some advice I found on Twitter and go to bed early, to take advantae of the time change. Because [Self-Care Sprints](https://twitter.com/Transition/status/1053331013177290752) are a real and valid thing.

Back to work tomorrow!
