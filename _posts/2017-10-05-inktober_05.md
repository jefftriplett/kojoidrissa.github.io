Today's hanzi is [æˆ‘](http://www.learnchineseez.com/read-write/traditional/view.php?code=6211&last=1), which is used in my old example sentence. It's always been one of my favorites to write. Even though I'm not very good at it. The right long stroke always starts too low and is too straight. ðŸ˜’

-  é€™æ˜¯{æˆ‘}çš„æ›¸
-  This is {I} possessive book
-  "This is my book".
