Another short post due to another long day. I've had an hour of sleep since my last post. My Vietnamese sister's father was buried today.

I changed the date formatting for the individual posts, so it now shows the post time (hours and minutes) on a 24-hour clock.

I've also added the appropriate year on the [Sexagenary Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagenary_cycle#Sexagenary_years) for this 60 day code challenge. In honor of my Viet sister's dad's death, I'm starting with the year he was born in (Metal Ox *{or Water Buffalo, since they're Vietnamese}*) and counting forward, one year per day, for the full 60 year cycle.

I may put it in the Categories or somewhere else, but for now it'll be in the title. I'll go back and update other titles soon. Now I'm just exhausted.
