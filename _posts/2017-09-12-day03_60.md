## Year of the [Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(Wu_Xing)) [Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(zodiac))

IT IS DONE!

HUGE thanks to the Lady Boss [Nicole](https://twitter.com/sodevious) who helped me get this worked out. DNS issues were a MAJOR point of frustration, but it's done.

NOW I have to figure out some stuff as far as categories, which will impact directory structure. But that's a task for tomorrow evening, I think. Just finished a 3 mile walk, now it's time for a shower and bed.

## To Do List for 2017-09-13
What I'll start/consider, not what I'll finish.

-  Gain a better understanding of Jekyll [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and [Front Matter Defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults)
-  [Configure](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) my timezone. Doesn't seem ENTIRELY necessary, but seems like a good practice.
-  Learn more about how Jekyll is configured in general. There HAS to be a tutorial video I can watch. But I think their docs are pretty good too. Don't go TOO far down that rabbit hole right now
-  Define some parameters for this code challenge. Figure out what other projects I'm gonna work on and how long this challenge is gonna be.
-  Play with the time display on posts and the home page. I'll probably want different variants of the [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Calendar_dates) format on the home page vs. individual posts.
-  Look into setting up [Drafts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/). Not sure if I want them or not. Leaning away from it at the moment?
-  Make note to self: gain a better understanding of DNS
