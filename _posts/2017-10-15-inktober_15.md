## [要](http://www.learnchineseez.com/read-write/traditional/view.php?code=8981&last=1)

I was surprised by how often this character came up in comics and other things I read while in China. Especially as part of the compound word ”需要“. I remember this so clearly because ”需“ was unknown to me. And for some reason, I didn't look it up or had trouble finding it? But there was about a year's time between when I'd figured out what it meant and how to SAY that first character.

And it's STILL a popular term. Here it is being used in the [first two lines of the chorus](https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2015/04/exo-call-me-baby-chinese-version) of the Mandarin version of EXO's "[Call Me Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-qm0xh0VK4)" (which was actually produced by American 'New Jack Swing' originator [Teddy Reilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Me_Baby))
