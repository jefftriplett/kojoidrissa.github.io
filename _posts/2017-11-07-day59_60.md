One more day.

Today was kinda slow. Worked on some talk proposals after work. Figured out PART of the solution to a problem AT work. Didn't get back to The Goat. :-(

But my sleep improvement process seems to be going ok? I was up earlier than usual this morning and got some exercise in.

It's a marathon, not a sprint.

<!-- I'll start back at [Three Strikes and Refactor](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_post_and_database.html#_three_strikes_and_refactor) tomorrow.
