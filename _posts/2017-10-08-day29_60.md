## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(Wu_Xing)) [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(zodiac))


As I mentioned [the other day]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-10-06-day27_60 %}), I got [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) installed on my gaming laptop. I used to to record audio, but haven't worked out the video/screen recording part. That'll be a task for later this week, or maybe next weekend. We'll see. I may install [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) too, for better/dedicated audio editing. Again, we'll see. One of my plans for this gaming laptop (besides gaming) was to do some A/V stuff and some other development stuff. I wanted to take advantage of the GPU on it.

But getting OBS going puts me on the path to do some coding streams. And maybe some, "Kojo talks about things while he plays video games" stuff. Which would PROBABLY be terrible.

But that might be better than WATCHING MY FACE while I talk about stuff. Who can know?!?
