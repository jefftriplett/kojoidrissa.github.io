## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(Wu_Xing)) [Water Buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_buffalo_(zodiac))


I'm starting another "[30 Day Github challenge](https://medium.com/@rxsharp/30-day-github-challenge-39d2a2cf68da)/[100 Days of Code](http://100daysofcode.com/)" type thing. I have that in quotes and say *"type thing"* because I probably won't follow the exact rules for either. I've got a couple of issues with each. THAT may get discussed in a later blog post. It could be of interest to people.  I also may want to do a different period of time, based on prior experience or my own quirks. For now, I can tell you what I WILL be doing:

-  Pushing at least one commit/day to Github (I want to use it's visual contribution tracker)
-  At least 30 days
-  Code, comments and blog posts (since my blog lives on Github) all count, but I'm trying to minimize days with ONLY blog posts. And a blog post only day needs to be a *technical* post about a development issue I'm dealing with.

That's what I've got for now. My next task will be getting my [custom domain](http://kojoidrissa.com/) pointing here, instead of [kojoidrissa.github.io](http://kojoidrissa.github.io/).

In sadder news, my Vietnamese sister's dad passed away today. <del>So, I may somehow incorporate my feelings on that into this code challenge. We'll see. It's all still pretty new.</del> So, my code challenge is 60 days, to represent the [60 year cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) used in East Asian calendars. I'm starting on the year he was born in, linked at the top of the post: [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(Wu_Xing)) [Water Buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_buffalo_(zodiac)).

## To Do List for 2017-09-11
This is what I'll start, not what I'll finish.

-  setup my [custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/)
-  Change time display on posts to [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Calendar_dates) format
-  Gain a better understanding of Jekyll [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and [Front Matter Defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults)
-  Look into setting up [Drafts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/). Not sure if I want them or not.
-  [Configure](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) my timezone. Doesn't seem ENTIRELY necessary, but seems like a good practice.
    -  Learn more about how Jekyll is configured in general
