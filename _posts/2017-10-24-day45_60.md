I feel like code won the battle today. ðŸ˜’

But I feel like I'll make a comeback tomorrow!

I also realize I need to learn how to type Unicode text codes for emoji and some æ¼¢å­—. I'll add that to my list of stuff to learn. Maybe [Katie](https://twitter.com/glasnt) can guide me to some tips on that. And by "maybe" I mean, "Of COURSE she can, because she knows ALL THE UNICODE THINGS". So, I should ask her!

Ok, now I feel better.
