## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(Wu_Xing)) [Ox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox_(zodiac))
Cycle 4!

Went out with my Viet sister Saturday to celebrate her birthday. She told me THEY use [Ox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox_(zodiac)), not [Water Buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_buffalo_(zodiac)). So, that's what I'll use.

Not much personal code today, but my Trello board is bearing fruit. Got ALL my travel plans for [PyCon Canada](https://2017.pycon.ca/) (**tickets still available!**) finished. So, I think this process will work for me. Shout out to [@rlconley](https://twitter.com/rlconley) for the reminder. Others have suggested it too, and I use it at work, but this is the first time I've really made decent use of it for personal stuff.

Speaking of which, tomorrow-Thursday will be busy evenings, so I need to head to bed soon. Later!
