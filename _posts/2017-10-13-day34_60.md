## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_(Wu_Xing)) [Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_(zodiac))
Back to MY animal, but not my element.

No code today. I'm just trying to juggle several things in my head. Hoping I'll get back to some code or related stuff tomorrow. MAYBE later tonight? But at the moment, I'm more inclined to just get some rest, try to get to bed semi-early and get going tomorrow. Today has been odd.
