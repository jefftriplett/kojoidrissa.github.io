Tonight I had two things I needed to work on. But then I got sidetracked by another blog post idea (which I started outlining and I'll probably publish tomorrow). So, I may not get as far on the 2nd thing as I'd hoped.

## Catching Up
I spoke at [PyGotham](https://twitter.com/pygotham) for the first time this year. The good news/bad news of that is, it was the weekend before DjangoCon. So, I was a bit busy. AND, for some reason [ahem](https://twitter.com/Transition/status/1060340569824731136), I had trouble getting my slides online while AT the conference. That's something I usually do BEFORE the talk or at least right after: push my slides to a Github repo.  But, I forgot how to use Git, then was in a bit of a DjangoCon rush and recovery right after that.

I know, excuses, excuses.

Anyway, I didn't FORGET, so I decided to make time this evening to FINALLY put my slides online. They're on [Github](https://github.com/kojoidrissa/pygotham_2018) and [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/kojoidrissa/a-jr-developers-guide-to-software-engineering). You can also find links to the slides and the video on YouTube with the [talk description](https://2018.pygotham.org/talks/a-junior-developer-s-guide-to-software-engineering/).

Which reminds me: I need to update my list of [presentations](http://kojoidrissa.com/presentations/). That's another thing I'm bad at.

## Pushing Ahead
On the topic of speaking, I'm speaking at [Python Day Mexico](http://pythonday.mx/) in [Guadalajara](https://goo.gl/maps/DZ3LG4NTtiT2) on 2018-12-01.  I'd like to give SOME of my talk in Spanish, or at least have some of the section headers in Spanish, since I'll be in a Spanish-speaking country. I realize most people aren't monolingual like most Americans, but still, I'd like to be respectful. And in my role as the NorAm Ambassador (the FINAL 2018 stop for [#NorAmGT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NorAmGT&src=typd) is real!), stepping up my Spanish couldn't hurt.

So, my PLAN was to work on that tonight. But I got sidetracked and ran out of time. So, that'll have to wait until tomorrow or this weekend.
