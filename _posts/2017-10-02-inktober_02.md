From yesterday's sentence.

-  {é€™}æ˜¯æˆ‘çš„æ›¸
-  {This} is I possessive book
-  "This is my book".

On the left is the [traditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters) version (I prefer those characters), on the right is [simplified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters).

My handwriting is TERRIBLE.ðŸ˜­ Which is ONE of the reasons I'm drawing hanzi. I might start trying to use the brush pen I have. If I can find it.
