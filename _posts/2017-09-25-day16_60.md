One of the MOST important skills you can have as a developer is reading and interpreting error messages. Sadly, it's a skill overlooked by most people looking to become developers. Here are some errors I got last night...hmm...wait a minute...

## Sidetracked: I have to figure out how to do a thing
*Realizes he's not quite sure how to add static images*

*Goes to figure it out*

*Realizes he commited a cardinal sin by hot linking to an image on [Day 12]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-21-day12_60 %})*

*Makes a mental note to fix that and write a post about it*

Ok, so guidelines for inlcuding images are in the [Writing Posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#including-images-and-resources) section of the docs. I'm able to understand the docs, I just have to make some choices.  Also, if I ever say "this seems straight forward" or "I understand" and someone reading this DOESN'T understand, feel free to [reach out to me](https://twitter.com/transition). I've got people like [Jeff](https://twitter.com/webology) to help me with Jekyll if I need it. But everyone isn't so lucky. So, if you're reading this, I guess you've got me? I'll do what I can.

*goes off to make choices and add images*

## Back to our original topic
Ok HERE are some errors I got last night:
![Liquid error messages]({{ site.url }}/assets/liquid_errors.png)

I got the error because I was trying to link to to a post named `2017-09-20-day13_60` (Day 13, Sep 20th, 2017) from within the post `2017-09-24-day15_60.md` ([Yesterday's post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-24-day15_60 %})). A quick bit of math tells you that if Day 13 was Sep 20, Day 15 couldn't be Sep 24. I made a type. The link should've been to `2017-09-22-day13_60`.

So, why'd the error show up so many times? Jekyll rebuilds the static site each time you change a file. So, each time I hit save, it regenerates the site. I'll include another picture of the locally-running process, so you can see how often I save a post as I'm writing it. It's a lot. Also, if this

![So. Many. Saves.]({{ site.url }}/assets/jekyll_site_regeneration.png)

So, why'd that error show up so many times in the FIRST picture? Because I hadn't noticed it and didn't check the link until I'd saved the file a bunch of times. But since that link didn't work, the rest of the page didn't render. I think I've already got too many screenshots in one post, but I may show you all that one another time.  The GOOD news is: Jekyll seems like it won't let you make TOO many mistakes.

Good night!
