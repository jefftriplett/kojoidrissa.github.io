## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_(Wu_Xing)) [Rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_(zodiac))
Finishing the 2nd of 5 cycles.

No code today. I've got a few [DEFNA](https://www.defna.org/) things I have to take care of tonight before our meeting tomorrow. And Wednesdays are my LONG days, so I need to get to bed early.

Maybe tomorrow I'll update my [About]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}), [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}) and [Presentations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link presentations.md %}) pages. Or, learn more about doing layout with [Liquid](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/)? I also need to get back to [where I stopped](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_unit_test_first_view.html) in Obey The Testing Goat.

Always more to do.
