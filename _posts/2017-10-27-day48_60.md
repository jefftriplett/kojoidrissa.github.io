## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(Wu_Xing)) [Rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_(zodiac))
Day 48/60 = 4/5 of the way through. The final cycle starts tomorrow!

Lots of debugging today at work. Which is how software engineering often works.

Reading the [Emily Bache](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/04/the-london-school-of-test-driven-development/) articles has exposed me to a bunch of OTHER stuff that I need to learn/grok/practice. So, THAT'S gonna be an ongoing thing. But I'm planning to get back to [Chapter 5](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_post_and_database.html) of The Goat tomorrow.

I've been low on sleep all week and I'm trying to improve my sleeping habits. SPECIFICALLY, trying to get up and go to sleep earlier. We'll see how THAT goes.
