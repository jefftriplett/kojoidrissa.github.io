## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(Wu_Xing)) [Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_(zodiac))

Another short post, as Wednesdays are my longest days. I made it to [Chapter 3](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_unit_test_first_view.html) of Obey The Testing Goat. Slow and steady wins the race.

I've also had some interesting adventures with converting images into text strings over the past [couple of weeks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-18-day09_60 %}). Got some of that finished today. That'll probably be a blog post at some point. Part of the final code looks KINDA like this, but I've spread this code out to make it clearer to understand.

{% highlight python %}
def get_jpeg_screenshot_as_base64_string(self):
    '''
    Convert JPEG version of screenshot to Base64 string
    :return: 64 bit encoded ascii string
    '''
    # This function returns the path of a saved JPEG screenshot
    jpg_screenshot = get_screenshot_as_jpeg()

    with open(jpg_screenshot, mode="rb") as jpg_image:
        # reading from an image gives a byte string of hex nums?
        byte_string_hex = jpg_image.read()

    # extra insurance, making sure I got the right data type
    assert isinstance(byte_string_hex, bytes)

    # converts to byte string of Base64 encoded ascii
    byte_string_64 = base64.b64encode(byte_string_hex)

    # converts to standard string of Base64 encoded ascii 
    ascii_string_64 = byte_string_64.decode('ascii')

    # Return the compressed version
    return base64.b64encode(jpg_image.read()).decode('ascii')

{% endhighlight %}

I'll probably talk more about this another time. NOW it's time for bed.
