## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_(Wu_Xing)) [Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(zodiac))


Most of my code work today has been updating my dev environment on my Mac to work on [Obey the Testing Goat](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html) stuff. Well, I guess I didn't NEED to, but I wanted to make sure things were where they should be. I had to look up how to update a specific package with [Brew](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ.html). Pretty straight forward.

I ran into a few oddities on my Windows box, but that machine hasn't been fully set up for dev anyway. I'll work on that later this week.

I also realized I'd made a slight error regarding [finishing a full 12 "year" cycle]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-22-day13_60 %}). Not so much an error, but it's not as clear as I'd like, so I'll update that post.

Off to bed soon!
