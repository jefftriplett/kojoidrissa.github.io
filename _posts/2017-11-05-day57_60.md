## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(Wu_Xing)) [Rooster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooster_(zodiac))
I took yesterday off. I spent most of the day watching the Overwatch World Cup [Semi-finals and Finals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_World_Cup_2017#Playoff_bracket). S. Korea (대한민국) won as expected, but Canada was a surprising Silver.

Then, last night (early this morning?) we switched back to Standard Time from [Daylight Saving Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) here in the US. So, I got an extra hour of sleep, which was nice.

I'll start back at [Three Strikes and Refactor](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_post_and_database.html#_three_strikes_and_refactor) tomorrow.
