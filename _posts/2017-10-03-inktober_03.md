To keep things simple, I'm going to follow the order of charachters shown [here](http://www.learnchineseez.com/read-write/traditional/). So, the next character is "[是](http://www.learnchineseez.com/read-write/traditional/view.php?code=662f&last=1)". It's also in yesterday's sentence.

-  這{是}我的書
-  This {is} I possessive book
-  "This is my book".
