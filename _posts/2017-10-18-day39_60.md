## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(Wu_Xing)) [Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(zodiac))

Besides pushing a bit of code at work, I spent time this evening going through my Trello boards, trying to get some things done and move forward.

Now I'm going to bed.
