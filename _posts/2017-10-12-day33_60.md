## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(Wu_Xing)) [Rooster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooster_(zodiac))

Came home from work and IMMEDIATELY went to sleep. Woke up about 15 minutes ago. Now going to walk with my sister.

You've GOT to take care of your body if you want your brain to function well. Balancing the stress (exercise, learning, coding etc) with the recovery (sleep, down time, etc) is key. I'm still working on it.
