## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(Wu_Xing)) [Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_(zodiac))

I started working on a `scratch_paper.py` file, that I'll use for various experiments or practicing stuff. Code samples I write as I read docs and such. I'll put that in my code challenge repo.

Now I'm going to bed.
