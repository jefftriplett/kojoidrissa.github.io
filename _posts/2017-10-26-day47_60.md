## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(Wu_Xing)) [Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(zodiac))

Finished [Chapter 4](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_philosophy_and_refactoring.html) of '[The Goat](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html)'. Instead of going straight on to [Chapter 5](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_post_and_database.html), I spent some time today reading a few blog posts about TDD that [HJWP](https://twitter.com/hjwp) linked to. The one he linked to directly was "[Outside-In development with Double Loop TDD](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/04/outside-in-development-with-double-loop-tdd/)", which helps explain [this diagram](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_philosophy_and_refactoring.html#Double-Loop-TDD-diagram) in more detail. But the author of the blog post, [Emily Bache](https://twitter.com/emilybache), had written two other related posts just before and after this one:

-  [The London School of Test Driven Development](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/04/the-london-school-of-test-driven-development/): I didn't even know there WERE these different "schools"!
-  ["Tell, Donâ€™t Ask" Object Oriented Design"](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/05/tell-dont-ask-object-oriented-design/): I need to improve my knowledge of OOD&A

So, I've been contemplating these things.
