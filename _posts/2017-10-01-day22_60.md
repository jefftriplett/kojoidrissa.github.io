## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(Wu_Xing)) [Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_(zodiac))
This is the year my Viet sister was born in.

Still catching up, but I've let my apartment get to out of whack. So, I need to do some cleaning first, THEN get back to other things.

## Catching up
-  One more [DEFNA](https://www.defna.org/) item to take care of
-  Correspondence that I need to reply to.
    -  I didn't forget about you [Jay](https://twitter.com/kjaymiller)!
    -  One other thing that's unannounced

## Moving ahead
-  Picking up where I left off in [Chapter 3](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_unit_test_first_view.html) of Obey The Testing Goat. My goal is to finish that Chapter today Didn't happen yesterday.
-  I want to clean up and represent the code snippet I posted a [few days ago]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-27-day18_60 %}), especially since [Trey](https://twitter.com/treyhunner) talked about it [yesterday](https://twitter.com/treyhunner/status/913476905738915842) on the [Weekly Python Chat](https://twitter.com/PythonChat). But that may, realistically, have to wait for tomorrow. Although tomorrow's also [PyWeb Houston](https://www.meetup.com/preview/python-web-houston/events/238808423), so, we'll see.

Now, let's see what REALLY happens today! I'll update before I go to bed.
