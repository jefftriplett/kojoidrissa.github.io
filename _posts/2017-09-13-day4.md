## Code Challenge
I've made a few decisions about my current code challenge.

### It'll be 60 days
Not only is this a good balance b/w 30 days (which I've done) and 100 days (which [LOTS of PEOPLE](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash) are doing), it's also to partially honor pushing ahead in difficult times. Day 1 of this code challenge was the day I found out my Vietnamese sister's dad passed away. The traditional Vietnamese calendar follows a [60 year cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagenary_cycle) (5 elements * 12 animals), so I'll do a day/year. I'll probably go back and adjust the blog titles or Front Matter appropriately.

### It won't be JUST code
I'm going to try to commit and push code to [Github](https://github.com/kojoidrissa) each day. However, I'll also include technical blogging, something I want to get better at. Also, each blog post (or update of one) IS a commit. Not that I'm trying to "game the system" (I'm only cheating myself), but I fell THINKING about what you're going to code (or NOT code) is just as valuable.

I'm also going to ignore the "tutorials don't count" rule from 100 Days of Code. I think those can be valuable starting points. I'm also not sure what else I'll try to learn or adapt during this period.

I might even do some streaming, if I can get things set up for it!

### Potential Projects
I'll have to narrow down this list and focus.

*  Continuing the [DRF-based tutorial](https://2017.djangocon.us/tutorials/catching-tweets-with-django-django-rest-framework/) I did at DjangoCon US 2017 with [Katia](https://twitter.com/lakatialira). I have a project in mind I wanted to build using that.
-  MVP Lightning Talk registration app for DjangoCon US 2018 (Django 1.11)
-  MVP Sprints sign-up app for DjanogCon US 2018 (Django 1.11)
-  Work on my die-rolling Flask/Twillio app
    -  Porting it to the new Twillio API
    -  Porting it to Bottle
    -  Building a web interface for the existing version
    -  Building a *"Software Engineering for Beginners"* tutorial around it
*  Work on my front-end skills with a project to be named later
*  A comparison of Python-based static site generators
    -  [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/) (the most well known, I think)
    -  [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) (supports Jupyter notebooks as input!)
    -  [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/): I've heard a lot of good things about it
-  Gas mileage tracking app (Bottle or Flask)
-  I'll almost definitely work on some talk ideas. That seems to be a thing I do now. I'm also not sure if I'm GIVING any more talks this year.

## To Do List for 2017-09-14
What I'll start/consider, not what I'll finish.

-  Narrow down and prioritize my projects. Pick a starting point.
-  Gain a better understanding of Jekyll [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and [Front Matter Defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults)
    +  If I'm going to work on my tech blogging, having the posts organized/categorized is an important part of that. But I don't want to spend TOO much time "tinkering" with just that. I'd rather focus more on WRITING about my coding now. I can "optimize" later.
-  Learn more about how Jekyll is [configured](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) in general. There HAS to be a tutorial video I can watch. But I think their docs are pretty good too. Don't go TOO far down that rabbit hole right now. See above point.
-  Play with the time display on posts and the home page. I'll probably want different variants of the [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Calendar_dates) format on the home page vs. individual posts.
-  Make note to self: gain a better understanding of DNS

Busy week(end) ahead. See you all tomorrow!
