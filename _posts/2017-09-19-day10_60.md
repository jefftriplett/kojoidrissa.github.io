## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(Wu_Xing)) [Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_(zodiac))
This is the sign I was born under. 😀👍🏾🐶

## At the meetup
Today was another busy day (as tomorrow will be). We host our [local Python meetup](https://www.meetup.com/preview/python-14/events/242580962) at the office where I work. That's tonight (I started this post before the meetup, as shown in the timestamp), so I'll be at work later than usual.

## Home and getting ready for bed. 
I've been reading the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs), so I can learn more about what I can do with it. I'm glad I worked out the code highlighting [yesterday]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-18-day09_60 %}). I'm reading the section on [posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) now, but I had to jump ahead to [linking to posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#linking-to-posts) in the Templates section to learn how to make the link to yesterday's post in such a way that it won't break. Still LOTS to learn. I'm also looking forward to learning more about [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), as templating languages are a weak point for me. It's an ongoing process. And I'm planning to document that process (along with other stuff I learn) here.
