## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(Wu_Xing)) [Tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_(zodiac))

No, not the game or Beyonce song...

Today's post is an exercise for the reader, as I've got to go meet my Viet sister soon to exercise. I found this libarary called "[Halo](https://github.com/ManrajGrover/halo)", that makes activity spinners for CLI tools. This was the ⚡️Talk I gave [Monday]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-10-02-day23_60 %}). So, create a [virtual environment](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) *(I should write a post on dependency management)*, then `pip install halo` and try the code below. I'll explain it tomorrow or later this week. Lines 7 & 10 determine how long it runs.

{% highlight python linenos %}
from halo import Halo # pip install halo first
import time
 
spinner = Halo({'text': 'Calculating...',  'color': 'red','spinner': 'dots8'})
spinner.start()
counter = 0
while counter < 51:
                # print(counter)
                counter += 1
                time.sleep(.1)
# Run time consuming work here
# You can also change properties for spinner as and when you want
 
# spinner.stop()
spinner.succeed()

{% endhighlight %}
