## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(Wu_Xing)) [Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_(zodiac))


Not much to report. Did a little reading in [Chapter 4](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_philosophy_and_refactoring.html). I also watched a video from PyCon Canada 2016 by Brandon Rhodes (PyCon US 2016-17 Conference Chair and Dropboxer) on [Using Python to power Selenium at scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1aUuqKg_gA). Partially because this is what I do at work, and also because I was checking out last year's PyCon Canada. 

I'm checking out LAST year's PyCon Canada because [I'm speaking](https://2017.pycon.ca/schedule/15/) at THIS year's PyCon Canada. So, that's a thing.

Ok, I'm gonna go do...something...now. ðŸ˜‚

Later!
