The image below is my rendition of "的", the most common Chinese character, per [this site](http://www.learnchineseez.com/read-write/traditional/). More on what I'm doing for [#inktober2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/inktober2017?src=hash) later, but check out [Inktober](https://twitter.com/inktober/status/911044711774687232) for more details. I'm 'drawing' hanzi.

"的" is the most commonly used hanzi and it's most common use is as a possessive particle. Here's a direct transliteration. Each English word corresponds to one hanzi (charachter)

-  這是我{的}書
-  This is I {possessive} book

So, "This is my book".
