## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(Wu_Xing)) [Monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_(zodiac))


A light day today. I figured out how to update the post template, so if there IS an `update` timestamp, it'll show at the top of the post. Not sure if I'm going to leave it there, but it's fine for now. Still learnign to work with variables. [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/variations/) is a bit different from the Python-based stuff I'm used to. So, my post from [yesterday]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-28-day19_60 %}) should show that.
