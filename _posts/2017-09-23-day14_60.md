## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_(Wu_Xing)) [Tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_(zodiac))

I'm starting my read of [Obey the Testing Goat](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html). I'll buy a copy soon, but this is the fastest way to get started. First goal: get through [Part 1](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/preface.html#_outline) and see what I can apply. I plan to write a review on Amazon after I'm done with each part. Harry broke the book into 3 parts:

-  *[The Basics](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/part1.harry.html)*
-  *[Web Development Essentials](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/part2.harry.html)*
-  *[More Advanced Testing Topics](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/part3.harry.html)*

I may write a review sooner if I think it makes sense. Shout-out to [Harry Percival](https://twitter.com/hjwp) for making the book available online!
