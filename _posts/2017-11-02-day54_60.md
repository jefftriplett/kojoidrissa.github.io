## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_(Wu_Xing)) [Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_(zodiac))
90% done!


[Chapter 5](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_post_and_database.html) of The Goat is denser than the others. It's taking me longer to get through. But I'm also stopping to try to better absorb and internalize the ideas. Over the past couple of days I've gotten to [Three Strikes and Refactor](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_post_and_database.html#_three_strikes_and_refactor), which is where I'll pick up next time.

My sleep improvments are an ongoing thing. But that's one reason I'm shutting down a bit early tonight. I'm trying to move towards more "early to bed, early to rise", instead of the opposite.
