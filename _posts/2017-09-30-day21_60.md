## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(Wu_Xing)) [Rooster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooster_(zodiac))

## Catching up
-  Take care of some [DEFNA](https://www.defna.org/) stuff
-  I had a few of different things I pushed back because of Hurricane Harvey and my Viet sister's dad's funeral. I need to catch up with those.

## Moving ahead
-  Picking up where I left off in [Chapter 3](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_unit_test_first_view.html) of Obey The Testing Goat. My goal is to finish that Chapter today.
-  Figuring out what else to work on next. There are MANY options.
