## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(Wu_Xing)) [Rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_(zodiac))


Just realized that I'm 20% through this challenge. This is also my first post with an image in it. Wise words indeed, attributed to [Arthur Ashe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Ashe)

Like I said yesterday, I'm still [pretty worn out]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-20-busy_summer %}) and a couple of new issues popped up yesterday. Hopefully they won't have too big of an impact. As a result, there'll probably be more building out this blog and writing posts than I'd originally planned. But as a friend pointed out to me today, you have to [Start where you are, Use what you have, & Do what you can](https://twitter.com/TheRealHipHopEd/status/910772813119787008). So, that's what I'm gonna do.

I think I'm gonna take the rest of the night off. I might update my [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}) or [Presentations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link presentations.md %}) pages. Or, I might just read some and go to bed early. We'll see.

I also need to do something with that [About]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}) page. I don't want to just leave the default stuff there.

And, I just found a typo in some of my links. Gotta fix that.
