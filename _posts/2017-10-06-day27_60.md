## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(Wu_Xing)) [Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(zodiac))

Another day without much code to talk about. But I may spend some time over the weekend trying to get [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) or [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) going on my gaming rig. Partially because I've been considering streaming for awhile (with encouragment from my friend [Mary](https://twitter.com/knittingdev), who's streaming with [The Weirdlings](https://go.twitch.tv/weirdlings) as I type this). And I'll also be the guest on an episode of the [Productivity In Tech](https://productivityintech.com/pitpodcast) podcast with [Jay Miller](https://twitter.com/kjaymiller) Sunday, so I'll need some sort of decent audio setup.

So, I took tonight "off" from writing new code, but I've got plenty to do over the weekend. We'll see how it goes.
