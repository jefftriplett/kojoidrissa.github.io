## [Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac#Years) of the [Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(Wu_Xing)) [Goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat_(zodiac))

I ended up skipping yesterday. There were various reasons, but mostly because I took some time off  to deal with some other things.

Onward!
