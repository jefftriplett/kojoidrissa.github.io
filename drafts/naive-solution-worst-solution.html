</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>While watching the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/165?s=e">Integer Multiplication</a> video as part of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algo">Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</a>, I finally found the language to describe a problem that's bothered me for quite some time. </p>
<p>There was a phenomenon I noticed in my career in accounting when it came to problem solving. It had two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a solution as <strong>quickly</strong> as possible. Five minutes of thinking is probably too long</li>
<li>Go with the first solution you come up with that's <strong>easy</strong> to understand.</li>
</ol>
<p>While these steps may seem fine (<em>"why waste time and/or come up with a complicated solution?"</em>) There are two problems with this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>A solution you find quickly may not be well thought out (well-designed)</li>
<li>A solution that's easy to <strong>understand</strong> (especially in a short period of time) may actually be more difficult to <strong>implement</strong>. This is an even larger problem if it's a solution that's going to be used repeatedly over time.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've seen this multiple times. There's a meeting, to figure out how to do 'this thing'. It's usually something that's been asked for out of the blue. So, there's a rush to come up with something ASAP. The faster you find a solution, the better. And bonus points for it being a solution that's easily <em>understood</em>. Not easily performed or well-performed. Just easily understood while it's being discussed.</p>
<p>Here's the problem with this solution: no one thinks through the implementation details. So, in 60 seconds, you come up with a new daily/weekly/monthly task that's going to take HOURS to perform each day/week/month. In perpetuity. Because it SEEMED simple and straightforward when you spent 60 seconds talking about it.</p>
<p>Thanks to Computer Science, I now have a formal name for this. <strong>The naive solution</strong>.</p>
