        <p>I'm starting this blog at 2014-11-24T22:14:07-06:00. It's part of my 2nd 30 day Github challenge. Specifically, the HTML/CSS/JS part. Though I may only spend a week on HTML/CSS, then another on JS. I also want to try to squeeze in as much DB and Django work as I can, along with more Python. We'll see how that works out, timing wise.
        </p>

        <p>I'm already realizing I need some sort of structure here. I guess I'll work that out tomorrow. Now, it's time for bed.
