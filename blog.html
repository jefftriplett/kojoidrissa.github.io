        <p>I'm starting this blog at the time stamp above. It's part of my 2nd 30 day Github challenge. Specifically, the HTML/CSS/JS part. Though I may only spend a week on HTML/CSS, then another on JS. I also want to try to squeeze in as much DB and Django work as I can, along with more Python. We'll see how that works out, timing wise.
        </p>

        <p>I'm already realizing I need some sort of structure here. I guess I'll work that out tomorrow. Now, it's time for bed. <span lang = "zh-hant">晚安好夢</span>.
        </p>

        <p>PS: Syntax highlighting is NOT as helpful when you've got <a href = "https://justgetflux.com/">Flux</a> running and it's late. :-/ This is a failed emoji: &#x1F612;

        <h2>2014-11-25T12:32:17-06:00</h2>
        <p>Played with the Lanugage attribute in HTML a little today. I'll get a lot of use out of that, as I tend to mix various Asian languages into what I write.
        </p>

        <p>New Ideas
            <ul>
                <li>create CSS to give each different day of this "blog" a different style</li>
                <li>Can I write JavaScript that will take the ISO timestamp I'm using and transform it into different date formats?</li>
                <li>can I use the timestamp to determine which entries get different styling? Detect the date and apply the differing styles based on that information?</li>
                <li>I wonder if the Arrow library in Python would let me transform the timestamp?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>I probably <del>won't</del> <ins>will</ins> use the Insert and Delete tags</p>

        <h2>2014-11-26T17:41:43-06:00</h2>
        <p>Not much today, going to bed early. But, I'll include a link to the <a href = "#start">start</a> of this blog.</p>

        <h2>2014-11-27T23:42:16-06:00</h2>
        <p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

        <h2>2014-11-28T22:33:50-06:00</h2>
        <p>I did nothing, but needed to make a commit. So ashamed. :-(</p>

        <h2>2014-11-29T23:52:44-06:00</h2>
        <p>I'm adding an image.</p>
            <img src = "images/shepherd_bridge.jpg" alt = "Shepherd Drive pedestrian bridge over Buffalo Bayou" title = "Shepherd Bridge over Buffalo Bayou, looking north at the American General campus" width = 90% height = 90% />

        <h2>2014-11-30T21:16:53-06:00</h2>
        <p>Now I'm reusing the same image, but with the &lt;figure&gt; tags</p>
        <figure>
            <img src = "images/shepherd_bridge.jpg" alt = "Shepherd Drive pedestrian bridge over Buffalo Bayou" title = "Shepherd Bridge over Buffalo Bayou, looking north at the American General campus" width = 90% height = 90% />
            <br />
            <figcaption>This  is the American General building, seen from the Shepherd  pedestrian bridge near sunlight.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>2014-12-03T12:50:37-06:00</h2>
        <p>I've been working on my <a href = "https://github.com/kojoidrissa/random_30Day_code/blob/master/anonymize.py">anonymization code</a>. It seems to be working as expected. I'll probably break it out into a separate repo at some point, now that I know it's functional. But I've still got some design work to do on it to make it actually USEFUL.
